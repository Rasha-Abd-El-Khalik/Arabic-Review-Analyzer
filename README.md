## üìå Overview
**Arabic-Review-Analyzer-RF-LR** is a machine learning project for classifying **Arabic news and reviews** into **Positive, Negative, or Neutral**.  
It leverages **traditional ML algorithms** such as **Random Forest (RF)** and **Logistic Regression (LR)** combined with specialized **Arabic preprocessing** (Camel Tools, normalization, tokenization, stopword removal).  
Text data is transformed into numerical embeddings, which are then fed into RF and LR classifiers for sentiment prediction.
